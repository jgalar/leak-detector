Writing Python Analyses - Leak Finder
-------------------------------------

Files provided:
buggy.c:	Buggy application we suspect of leaking.

run.sh:		Launches "buggy" with liblttng-ust-libc-pthread-wrapper
		already preloaded.

run_trace.sh:	Sets-up a tracing session capturing all userspace events
		and system calls (kernel instrumentation),
		launches "buggy",
		stops tracing when "buggy" has returned,
		destroys the session configuration.

		This script will enable the "vpid" context. The path
		where the trace has been saved will be printed out.
